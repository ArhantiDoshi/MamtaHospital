    <p>Gynaecology or gynecology is the medical practice dealing with the health of the female reproductive system (vagina, uterus, and ovaries). Outside medicine, the term means "the science of women". Its counterpart is andrology, which deals with medical issues specific to the male reproductive system.
Almost all modern gynaecologists are also obstetricians (see obstetrics and gynaecology). In many areas, the specialities of gynaecology and obstetrics overlap.</p>
